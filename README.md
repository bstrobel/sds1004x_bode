# Siglent SDS1000X-E and SDS800X-HD series Bode Plot

Bode plot with Siglent SDS1000X-E and SDS800X-HD oscilloscopes series and a non-siglent AWG.

## Overview

At a certain point after getting the SDS1204X-E oscilloscope I started to wonder if it might be possible to use the Bode plot function with a non-Siglent waveform generator. After some hours of researching and reverse engineering I wrote this Python program which is a small server which emulates Siglent arbitrary waveform generator.

The oscilloscope connects using LAN to a PC running this program. The program makes the oscilloscope think that it communicates with a genuine Siglent signal generator. The program extracts the commands sent to the generator, parses them and translates to the command set, which can be understood by the connected to the PC non-Siglent generator.

The program is written in Python and uses ```sockets``` library to connect to the oscilloscope and ```serial``` library for connecting to serial AWGs, and the ```PyVISA-py``` library for connecting to others.

Current version of the program was tested under Linux and MacOS only. Later, I'll test it under Windows too.

## Supported AWG Models

As of June 2024 the program supports the following models:

* **Uni-Trend UTG1000x (like the UTG1022X)** This is a 2 channel 40MHz AWG. It connects to the PC via USB, but not as "dumb" serial. You must provide a Visa compatible connection string as ```port```. See below.

* **Rigol DG800/DG900 series (like DG992)** When "liberated", this is a 2 channel 100MHz AWG with USB and (with the suitable adapter) ethernet interface. It is somewhat compatible with the SCPI 1992.0 standard. You must provide a Visa compatible connection string as ```port```. See below.

* **BK Precision BK4075** One channel 25MHz AWG. Requires a RS-232 serial port for the connection to a PC. It is compatible with the SCPI 1992.0 standard.

* **RD JDS6600** Chinese generator which is widely sold on eBay and AliExpress. It connects to the PC as a USB serial port.

* **Feeltech FY6600** Another Chinese generator which is widely sold on eBay and AliExpress. It also connects to the PC as a USB serial port.

* **AD9910 Arduino Shield** https://gra-afch.com/catalog/rf-units/dds-ad9910-arduino-shield/. It also connects to the PC as a USB serial port.

## Program Structure

TBD

## Oscilloscope Configuration

Before starting the program you have to tell the oscilloscope how to connect to the waveform generator. Connect your oscilloscope to the same network where your PC is connected. Then go to ```Configure => AWG I/O``` in the Bode plot settings. Define LAN connection and the IP addres of your PC as the AWG IP. After starting the program you can press ```Test Connection``` button to test the communication between the oscilloscope and the PC.

## Running The Program

To run this program you must have Python 3.11+ installed. Python 2.7 is not supported anymore.

The source code is located in the [```sds1004x_bode```](/sds1004x_bode) directory of this repository.

Python ```sockets``` requires elevated privileges in Linux, therefore the program has to be run with ```su``` or ```sudo``` command. 

The program must be run in a command line terminal. The file to be run is ```bode.py```. In order to run it, change the current path to the directory where you downloaded the source code. Then write the following command:

```sudo python bode.py <awg_name> [<port>] [<baud_rate>] [-udp] [-h]```

where

* ```<awg_name>``` is the name of the AWG connected to your PC:  ```jds6600```, ```bk4075```, ```fy6600```, ```ad9910```, ```dg800```, ```utg1000x``` or ```dummy```. Note that ```dg800``` might also work for other SCPI 1992.0 standard compatible AWGs.

* ```<port>``` is the port to which your AWG is connected. The type depends on you AWG, see the explanations above. For serial port AWGs, it will be something like ```/dev/ttyUSB0``` or ```/dev/ttyACM0```. If you use the ```dummy``` generator, you don't have to specify the port. If you use the ```dg800``` or ```utg1000x```, you must specify a Visa compatible connection string, like ```TCPIP::192.168.001.204::INSTR``` or ```USB0::9893::6453::DG1234567890A::0::INSTR```

* ```<baud_rate>``` The serial baud rate as defined in the AWG settings. Currently only ```bk4075``` supports it. If you don't provide this parameter, ```bk4075``` will use the default baud rate of 19200 bps. Two other AWGs don't require it: ```jds6600```, ```fy6600```, and ```ad9910``` run always at 115200 bps. The ```dummy``` generator doesn't use a serial port.

The ```dummy``` generator was added for running this program without connecting a signal generator. The program will emulate a Siglent AWG and the oscilloscope will generate a Bode plot but no commands will be sent to the AWG.

Use ```-udp``` if your scope is a SDS800X-HD, or another new Siglent scope.

Use ```-h``` for help text.

If the program starts successfully, you'll see the following output:

```
Initializing AWG...
AWG: jds6600
Port: /dev/ttyUSB0

After starting the program, follow the usual procedure of creating Bode plot. After starting the plotting, the program output will be similar to the following:

```
